These are the features that should be added to the visualCAmkES program.

* Ability to highlight control and hardware instances
* Showing all connection interfaces for each instance
* Showing more information about connections (which will lead to a GUI in which connections can be editted)
* Way of showing hierarchical attributes (hierarchical-attributes)
* Properly rendering a connection from one component to itself (testdataportbifurcate, testltouser)
* Ensuring that visualCAmkES will work in Qt5.6 (nice to do because 5.6 is a long-term support release)
