# The View python module

# This is where most of the gui work is done. 
# GraphWidget deals with the placement of all nodes and edge, and deals with overarching mouse events.
# Instance_Widget deals with drawing and managing of each node (which represents an instance in camkes).
# Connection_Widget deals with the drawing and managing of each edge (which represents a connection in camkes).
