Visualisation of Componentised Operating Systems
================================================

This repository houses the work for the Taste of Research project. The aim is to visualise the components in a componentised system like CAmkES. This project will be done for CAmkES. Ideally the final result will be a GUI application, from which a "main".camkes file will be read. From here, the camkes-tool parser will generate an ASTObject (LiftedAST), and this application will allow you to visualise, modify and create CAmkES application with a mouse. Of course, the project will be done in steps - documented below.
