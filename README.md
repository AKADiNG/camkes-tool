# CAmkES

This repository contains the code generator and templating system that form the
core of the [CAmkES component platform](http://sel4.systems/Info/CAmkES/). This
branch, "next," has a from-scratch re-implementation of the architecture
description parser and addresses several shortcomings of the "master" branch.
This branch is intended to supersede "master" in the future.

For more information about CAmkES functionality, see the
[documentation](docs/index.md).
