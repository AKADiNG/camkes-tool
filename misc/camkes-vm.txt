CAmkES VM details.

To ease use or development on CAmkES, I've created a VirtualBox image with all
the necessary dependencies pre-configured to build or modify CAmkES. You can
get the latest image from:

 duvel.ertos.nicta.com.au:/data/static/camkes-vm.zip

It is based on Ubuntu 13.10 server for i386 and has a single user account with
sudo access:

 Username: camkesuser
 Password: camkesuser

The upstream package repositories point at the NICTA proxy to reduce bandwidth.
Note that if you are trying to install anything (with apt-get) outside of the
NICTA network you will need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to point back at the
Ubuntu defaults. In addition to the base packages, it has the following
installed:

 - arm-none-eabi-gcc (ARM cross compiler from CodeSourcery)
 - build-essential (GCC dependency)
 - cabal (Haskell package manager)
 - data-ordlist (Haskell collections module)
 - gcc (Native C compiler)
 - ghc (Haskell compiler)
 - git (version control tool)
 - i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc (IA32 cross compiler from CodeSourcery)
 - jinja2 (Python templating package)
 - libxml2-utils (xmllint and friends)
 - MissingH (Haskell boost module)
 - mercurial (version control tool)
 - qemu (Platform simulator)
 - pip (Python package manager)
 - ply (Python lexing and parsing package)
 - pyelftools (Python package for reading ELF files)
 - split (Haskell list utils module)
 - tempita (Python templating package)
 - texlive-full (LaTeX framework)
 - vim (editor)

It has an SSH server running on the standard port, 22. If you're running this
image on KVM, you should be able to SSH in as camkesuser via the internal
network tap that KVM provides. I.e. log in to the VM normally and run ifconfig
to get its IP, then SSH to this from your local host.

If you're running it on VirtualBox, the easiest way is to tell VirtualBox to
forward a local port to the VM. Setup a new port forwarding rule (Settings >
Network > Advanced > Port Forwarding) with the following:
 Name: SSH
 Protocol: TCP
 Host IP: (blank)
 Host Port: 2222
 Guest IP: (blank)
 Guest Port: 22
You should now be able to SSH into the guest from your local host using port
2222:
 ssh -p 2222 camkesuser@localhost
